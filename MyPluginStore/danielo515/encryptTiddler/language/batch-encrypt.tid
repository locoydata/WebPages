Use below controls to encrypt or decrypt a bunch of tiddlers. Encryption ''controls are hidden'' until you type something in the search box. All listed tiddlers will be affected. The presence of a small padlock (<span class="pc-listItem-lock">{{$:/core/images/locked-padlock}}</span>) next to the tiddler title indicates that particular tiddler is already encrypted.
